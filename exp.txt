For opcodes 1,2,7,8 there are 3 parameters, so they follow in the format of ABCDE, where C, B, A corresponds to the mode of the first, second, and third parameters respectively. Pad with 0s if necessary.

Examples:

21001,11,12,13: add position 11 to immediate value 12 and write to relative position 13
1202,11,12,13 : multiply relative position 11 to immediate value 12 and write to position 13
22207,11,12,13 : if relative position 11 is less than relative position 12, then write 1 to relative position 13, otherwise write 0 to relative position 13
7,11,12,13 : if position 11 is less than position 12, then write 1 to position 13, otherwise write 0 to position 13
For opcode 3, there is only 1 parameter, so they follow in the format of CDE where C is the mode of the single parameter. Again pad with 0s if necessary.

Examples:

3,11 : read input and write to position 11
203,11 : read input and write to relative position 11
Hope this makes sense!

Thank you for the examples!

This finally allowed me to debug what went wrong, my code totally ignored the A for opcode 1,2,7,8
